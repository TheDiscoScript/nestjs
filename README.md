# nestjs

Welcome. This repository will be used for experimenting with new ideas relevant to NestJS, implementing useful practices, and hopefully prroviding some useful examples for the community.
It is basically a playground for me to try out new things and learn.

## Structure

This repository is organized by folders, each representing a different project or topic of exploration. As of now, the following folders exist:

- nx-useful-implementations: This is where we kick things off, with various useful practices (or patterns) that can be beneficial for Nest projects. I will be using nx monorepo to organize the code, as I like using apps and libs to separate concerns.

Inside each folder, you'll find another README file that will guide you through the contents and provide more detailed information.

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome! If you have an idea, a pattern, or a useful practice you'd like to share, please:

- Create a new folder if your idea doesn't fit into any of the existing categories.
- Add a README file to your folder explaining what your project or pattern is about.
- Submit a pull request. Once approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

## Getting Started

Use `npm install` to install husky and commitlint. This will ensure that your commits follow the conventional commit format.

I will be prolly using docker for most of my projects, so you can just run `docker-compose up` or `npm i` and script in package.json to get started.
