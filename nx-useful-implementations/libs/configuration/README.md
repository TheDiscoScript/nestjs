# configuration

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Description

I am currently working on having Injectable ConfigService, which will be able to read configuration from multiple sources.
As it is not finished yet, I will be using my old approach - function that return configuration object.

### Goals

-   Better implementation of ConfigService, preferably DynamicModule for Configuration?

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test configuration` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
